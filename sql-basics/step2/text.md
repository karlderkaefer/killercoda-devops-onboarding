# Filtering Data with WHERE Clause

In this section, you'll learn how to filter data in SQL using the WHERE clause. This is crucial for narrowing down search results to specific criteria.

## Using the WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Task
- Write a query to select all users from the `users` table who are over 30 years old.
- Execute the query and observe how the results are filtered.

Remember to use logical operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `<>` (not equal) to specify conditions.

Good luck with filtering your data!
