# Introduction to JOIN Operations in SQL

In this final section, you'll learn about JOIN operations in SQL, which allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

## Basic JOIN Operations
- `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.

## Task
- Use INNER JOIN to combine data from two sample tables (we'll provide another table for this exercise).
- Try a LEFT JOIN to see the difference in results.

This is your first step into more advanced SQL querying techniques.

## Viewing Table Structure
To view the structure of the tables, use the command:
```sql
PRAGMA table_info(table_name);
```
